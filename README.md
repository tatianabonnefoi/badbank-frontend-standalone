About

This project was created to practice master React, React States, React Context creating a user session, etc. You can access a static page using the link above. This is a simple app where you can access an ATM like, create account, login, deposit and withdraw.

This project was also created as stand alone app. You can access on github link:


Components:

“Create Account” You can create an account. Including field validation checks.

All the fields must be field e-mail must follow the a traditional email address structure XXXXXX@YYYYY.com Pasword must be longer than 8 characters “LoginUser” This page is still under construction, however the front end portin allows the user to sign in and out.

“Deposit” This page allows the user to Deposit money. A sweet alert will pop if when the money is deposit successfuly.

“Withdraw” This page allow to substract money. An alert will display if the transaction is not possible.

“AllData” Unfortunatelly this is not a secure bank! all users info will be displayed.

Roadmap and future improvements:

Many improvement to be made.

Improve Log in functionality by creating authorization tokens. Upload All Data to a secure cloud database and creat a asynch funtion to call for information. Improve the communication between context and existing pages. License

This project was created under MIT License

Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
